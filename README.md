# Multilayer Perceptron to Add Two Numbers
This simple implementation demonstrates the theory behind a neural network to simulate an and logic gate.

### Project Overview
- **Language**: C++
- **Libraries**: Standard Library only
- **Purpose**: This project is designed as a demonstration of the principles of neural networks from scratch.

### Future Plans
This is the second of many neural network models I plan to build and share. My research has shown a lack of accessible source code tackling this concept, so I aim to contribute to this area.

### Contributions
I welcome any suggestions, improvements, or feedback! Feel free to reach out or create an issue if you have ideas for enhancements.

Thanks for checking out my project!
